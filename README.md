<p align="center">
  <strong>This is possibly the fastest version yet.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Version 1 was fully made by Max from scratch. Version 2 used some help from Grok AI to clean up and optimize parts of the code, though it also introduced a lot of issues.  
  Version 2.5 builds directly on those releases no major rewrites, just smoother performance, reduced lag, and faster execution overall. It keeps the same design and logic, refined for better consistency and speed.

  This tool may still cause minor client-side lag due to its high-speed methods, though it’s lighter and more stable than before. Server lag usually becomes noticeable after 1–5 minutes of continuous use.
